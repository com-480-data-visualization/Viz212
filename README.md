## About LoveLogic

LoveLogic is an interactive experience that reveals what really happens on dating apps. From who's swiping to what they're looking for, each part of the site tells a piece of the story. Explore real data through fun and intuitive visuals, and see how people connect in today’s digital world. Ready to challenge what you think you know about modern love?

## 🚧 Current MVP & What's Coming

The current version of **LoveLogic** includes the following visualizations:

- **Age Distribution** – explore how age and gender relate to different relationship goals  
- **Interest Cloud** – discover which interests are most common among users  
- **Usage Patterns** – see how often people use the app and how much they swipe  
- **Relationship Goals** – breakdown of user intentions across demographics  

We've also started setting up two major features:

- **Profile Explorer** – UI components are in place, but data integration is still in progress  
- **Swipe Game** – planned and designed, but not yet implemented

### 🔮 Coming Later This Semester

We’re planning to roll out:

- **Swipe Game** – interactive quiz where users test their intuition against real data  
- **Full Profile Explorer** – dynamic browsing of user profiles with filters and animations  
- **Advanced Filtering** – multi-dimensional filters with real-time data updates  
- **UX Improvements** – feature tour, saved preferences, and shareable insights  
- **Visual Enhancements** – smoother transitions, custom themes, and downloadable charts
